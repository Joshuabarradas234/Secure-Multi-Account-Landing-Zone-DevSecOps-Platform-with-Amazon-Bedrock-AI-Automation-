# Diagrams

This folder contains architecture visuals used in the root README.

## Files
- `architecture.jpg` – rendered diagram used in README (exported image)
- `architecture.drawio` – editable source (optional but recommended)

## How to update the diagram (recommended workflow)
1. Edit `architecture.drawio` in draw.io / diagrams.net
2. Export to PNG/JPG (high resolution)
3. Replace `architecture.jpg`
4. Commit both updates in the same commit

## Conventions
- Keep diagram names stable (so README links don’t break)
- Prefer one “main” architecture diagram for recruiter readability
