# secure-aws-landing-zone-devsecops

## Overview

This project establishes a secure, enterprise-grade AWS cloud foundation using a multi-account structure, zero-trust networking, centralized logging, and a fully automated DevSecOps pipeline. It integrates with Azure Entra ID for federated SSO, enforces least privilege and encryption everywhere, and demonstrates automated threat detection, response, and compliance.

**What sets this project apart:**  
It leverages Amazon Bedrock to add AI-powered automation—summarizing security findings, generating incident reports, and enabling natural language Q&A on runbooks and security best practices. This makes the platform not only secure by default, but also intelligent and future-ready.



## Key Features

- **Multi-Account Structure:** Management, Security, and Workloads accounts via AWS Organizations & Control Tower.
- **Federated SSO:** Azure Entra ID integration with IAM Identity Center.
- **Zero Trust Networking:** Private subnets, VPC endpoints, Network Firewall, WAF.
- **Centralized Logging:** Org-wide CloudTrail, AWS Config, S3 with KMS and Object Lock.
- **Security Operations:** Security Hub, GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, Security Lake, auto-remediation.
- **DevSecOps Pipeline:** Terraform IaC, security scanning, policy as code, automated reporting.
- **Demo Workload:** API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB, fully secured.
- **AI Automation (Amazon Bedrock):** Summarize security findings, generate incident reports, and answer natural language queries on runbooks.
- **Compliance & Governance:** SCPs, Config rules, CIS/FSBP mapping, runbooks, and dashboards.

## Decision-making (ADRs)

This repo uses **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** to document *why* key design choices were made.

Each ADR answers:
1) **Which alternatives** were considered?
2) **Why this choice** was selected (security / operability / speed)?
3) **How trade-offs** were balanced (performance vs cost vs security)?

📌 ADRs live here: `docs/decisions/`  
Suggested reading order:
- `ADR-0001-multi-account-structure.md` (landing zone + org design)
- `ADR-0002-logging-and-security-services.md` (Security Hub, GuardDuty, Config, etc.)

## Business perspective (value + cost)

### Why a business would pay for this
This platform reduces *real operational risk* and improves *audit readiness*:

- **Lower breach likelihood** via centralized controls (SCP guardrails, least privilege, continuous monitoring)
- **Faster incident response** with Security Hub + GuardDuty/Inspector findings feeding runbooks
- **Audit/compliance efficiency** via centralized evidence (CloudTrail/Config + immutable S3 archive patterns)
- **Developer velocity with safety** (DevSecOps pipeline + policy-as-code + supply-chain scanning)
- **Executive visibility** through consistent security reporting across accounts/environments

### Monthly cost model (what drives spend)
Monthly running cost is dominated by a small set of drivers:

1) **Logging & retention**
   - CloudTrail / Config / VPC Flow Logs / Security Lake storage & query
   - Longer retention + higher log volume => higher cost

2) **Security services**
   - Findings volume + number of resources/accounts affects tools like GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, Security Hub

3) **Network egress / NAT**
   - NAT Gateway + data processing can become a major cost in private subnet designs

4) **CI/CD + scanning**
   - Artifact storage, container scanning, SBOM generation, pipeline runs

5) **AI automation (optional)**
   - If enabled, cost depends on: how many incidents/findings are summarized and the size of prompts/responses

### Practical cost ranges (order-of-magnitude)
**Small lab / portfolio demo:** low, if you keep log volume tiny and retention short.  
**Small business / 2–5 accounts:** typically moderate if Security Hub/GuardDuty/Inspector are enabled and logs retained.  
**Enterprise / many accounts + high logging:** cost grows mainly with log volume, retention, and SIEM/query usage.

> Tip: the “knobs” that most reduce monthly cost are: log retention policies, Security Lake/SIEM query patterns, NAT usage, and scoping Macie/Inspector coverage.

### How to estimate it properly (what you'd do in a real org)
- Use AWS Pricing Calculator with assumptions:
  - number of accounts
  - GB/day of logs (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, app logs)
  - retention period (days/months)
  - number of workloads/resources scanned
  - incident volume for optional AI summaries
- Track spend by tagging (env/account/team) and set budgets + alerts per account.
